# pdeHeat
**pdeHeat** is an R package designed for the modeling and numerical simulation of one-dimensional (1D) heat diffusion. It is specifically tailored to validate the thermal safety of processes such as food pasteurization.
The package allows users to solve the heat equation using classic numerical methods (Explicit and Crank-Nicolson) and provides integrated tools for visualization and safety analysis.

## 📦 Installation

### From GitHub (recommended)

You first need to install **devtools** (if not already installed):

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("halisadiya753-cmd/pdeHeat")
```

## 🔧 Usage Examples

```r
library(pdeHeat)

# 1. Grid Configuration (L=40mm, total time=1200s)
grid <- initialize_grid(L = 40, nx = 41, t = 1200)

# 2. Initial Condition (Uniform temperature of 4°C)
u0 <- initial_condition(grid$x, type = "constant", value = 4)

# 3. Boundary Conditions (85°C heating on both sides)
bc <- list(left = 85, right = 85)

# 4. Simulation using the Crank-Nicolson method
# alpha = 0.12 (Typical thermal diffusivity for moist food/meat)
U <- solve_heat1d_cn(u0, L = 40, alpha = 0.12, dt = grid$dt, t = 1200, bc = bc)

# 5. Food Safety Validation
# Target threshold of 72°C required for at least 15 seconds
safety_result <- check_safety(U, dt = grid$dt, threshold = 72, required_time = 15)
```
## 📊 Visualization
```r
# Generate a temporal Heatmap
plot_heat_map(U)

# Display the temperature profile at the end of the simulation
plot_solution_profile(U, time_index = nrow(U))
```
