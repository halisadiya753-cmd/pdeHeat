\title{Check Pasteurization Safety}
\usage{
check_safety(U, dt, threshold = 72, required_time = 15)
}
\arguments{
\item{U}{matrix Numerical solution matrix from solve_heat1d_cn.}

\item{dt}{numeric Time step used in the simulation.}

\item{threshold}{numeric Critical temperature target (default is 72°C).}

\item{required_time}{numeric Minimum time required at the center (in seconds).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{safe}{logical; TRUE if the safety criteria are met.}
\item{duration_above}{numeric; total time the center stayed above the threshold.}
}
\description{
Analyzes the temperature at the center of the food item to determine if
safety thresholds were met during the process.
